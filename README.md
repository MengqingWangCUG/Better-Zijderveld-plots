# Better-Zijderveld-plots
Zijderveld plots are among the most commonly used diagrams in paleomagnetism. However, generating visually appealing Zijderveld plots can be challenging due to the need for coordinate transformations that are specific to the data. This project offers a solution by providing a Python implementation that simplifies the process of creating these plots.

A good Zijderveld plot should have the following characteristics: first, the scale length of the coordinate axes should correspond to the length of both the positive and negative axes.
The repository is under development.
