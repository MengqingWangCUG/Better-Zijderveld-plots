# Better-Zijderveld-plots
Zijderveld plots are among the most commonly used diagrams in paleomagnetism. However, generating visually appealing Zijderveld plots can be challenging due to the need for coordinate transformations that are specific to the data. This project offers a solution by providing a Python implementation that simplifies the process of creating these plots.
